# HomemadeArcade
Classic Arcade games made from home for educational resource.

Inspiration to make these games and live dev streams comes from HandmadeHero.org. HandmadeHero.org is a series of game development live streams by Casey Muratori, showing how to develop a professional quality game, from the ground up, without the use of 3rd party libraries or engines and without the use of C++ constructs which frankly add burden to the life of a game developer.

It's about getting back to old school programming, programming that was fun, before OOP and managed languages came along and took our fun away.

In a similar vein, HomemadeArcade is a series of game development live streams showing how to develop simple classic arcade games. The games we used to play in arcades in the 1980s.

I will be using similar programming techniques as Casey. Mainly C, no OOD/OOP, no classes, no member functions, no inheritence, no virtual functions, no operator overloading, no templates, no std libraries, just plain old data structures and functions manipulating those data structures. No 3rd party engines or libraries, with one exception, I'll be using the Vulkan API for graphics.

I've decided to develop several small arcade games rather than one big game to try and keep things simplier than handmadehero but hopefully also provide reasonable programming education for beginner to intermediate level programmers.

# Space Invaders

The first game we will develop in the series is classic Space Invaders. One of the original arcade games, still fun to play. Easy and quick to program.

Keep on programming and gaming.
